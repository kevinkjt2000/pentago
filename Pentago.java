/* This Pentago class extends the Game class and implements the
 * abstract methods reset, draw, and obtainInput.
 * Pentago is a game that is played by two players.  The default
 * constructor for Pentago lets the game be played by a human and an
 * AI.  Also, the default constructor sets the human to have the first move.
 * Pentago is won when a player gets five marbles in a row (horizontally, 
 * vertically, or diagonally).  On each turn the active player places a marble
 * and rotates one of the quadrants of the six by six playing board.
 * The rotation must be 90째 counterclockwise or clockwise, and can not be 0째, 
 * 180째, 360째, etc.  Each quadrant of the board is a three by three subsection of
 * the main six by six board.
